# Classic and Common Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository is a continual work in progress, containing my work in implementing some of the classics and the common stuff we work with. 

So far, it contains:
* Mergesort, implemented using a queue data structure
* A few different means of implementing a Fibonacci sequence function
* An implementation of a Trie data structure with support for autocomplete
* A dynamic programming approach to finding the smallest missing number in a sequence of integers
* A divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding the median value in an array (work in progress)
